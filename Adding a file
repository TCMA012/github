Adding a file to a repository using the command line

You can upload an existing file to a repository on GitHub.com using the command line.

Tip: You can also add an existing file to a repository from the GitHub website.

This procedure assumes you've already:

    Created a repository on GitHub, or have an existing repository owned by someone else you'd like to contribute to
    Cloned the repository locally on your computer

Warning: Never git add, commit, or push sensitive information to a remote repository. Sensitive information can include, but is not limited to:

    Passwords
    SSH keys
    AWS access keys
    API keys
    Credit card numbers
    PIN numbers

For more information, see "Removing sensitive data from a repository."

    On your computer, move the file you'd like to upload to GitHub into the local directory that was created when you cloned the repository.
    Open Terminal.
    Change the current working directory to your local repository.
    Stage the file for commit to your local repository.

    $ 
    git add .
    
git add 'Learning TypeScript'/'Learning TypeScript.ts'


    # Adds the file to your local repository and stages it for commit. To unstage a file, use 'git reset HEAD YOUR-FILE'.

    Commit the file that you've staged in your local repository.

    $ 
    git commit -m "Add existing file"

    # Commits the tracked changes and prepares them to be pushed to a remote repository. To remove this commit and modify the file, use 'git reset --soft HEAD~1' and commit and add the file again.

    Push the changes in your local repository to GitHub.com.

    $ git push origin YOUR_BRANCH
    git push origin main

    # Pushes the changes in your local repository up to the remote repository you specified as the origin
